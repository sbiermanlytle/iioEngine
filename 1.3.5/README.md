iioengine
========= 

iio Engine is a JavaScript framework that streamlines the development HTML5 Canvas applications. The whole package is open source, and free to use and extend for any purpose. This repo contains all published copies and working editions of iio Engine.

All applications created with the iio Engine may be uploaded and hosted for free at iioApps.com.

iio Engine 1.3.4 is the working copy of a push to finalize the upgrade. It will be modified frequently as it is tested and extended. The minified version will not be available until the new version is published.

The API and syntax are a lot different from 1.2. You may wish to use that version (available at iioEngine.com) if you would like a better documented and more stable platform to work with.
